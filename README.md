## üîé About the project

The Casting Agency API  is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies.
This is the capstone project of Udacity fullstack nanodegree program. It demonstrates our skills to develop and deploy a RESTful API.

## üëâ What I have built ?

- **Backend**
  - Fully functionnal API to manage Actors and Movies
  - Applying software system risk and compliance principles
  - SQLAlchemy
  - Migrations

- **Securing The REST API**
  - Implementing authentication and authorization in Flask using the [Auth0 API](https://auth0.com/)
  - Designing against key security principals
  - Implementing role-based control design patterns

- **Testing**
  - Testing endpoints with **Postman** and **Pytest**

- **Devops**
  - CircleCI pipline to automate tests after commit
  - Docker
  - Deploying the API to Heroku


## ü§ì Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.10

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

## üíª Running the server

First ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

You will need to add envirement variables, either to the ` setup.sh ` or to ` .env ` file:

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=""
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=""
AUTH0_DOMAIN=""
ALGORITHMS=['RS256']
API_AUDIENCE=""
```

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

```bash
source ./setup.sh
```

Then run the server:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.


## ‚úÖ Running the tests

To run tests:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```

To get the coverage report:

```bash
coverage report -m
```

**Coverage report example**

## üìñ API Reference

### Getting Started

- **Base URL**:
  - local app: the default url is http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
  - deployed app:

- **Authentication**: Endpoints need a JWT token generated by the Auth0 after user's login.
  - Bearer {token} 
- **Permission**: All endpoints need a specific permission (see bellow for more detail).
- **Headers**: 
  - "Content-Type": "application/json"
  - "Accept": "application/json"

### Postman request examples

A postman collection with request examples could be found in the postman folder: "FSND-Casting-Agency.postman_collection.json"


### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```json
{
    "success": false, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request",
}
```

The API will return three error types when requests fail:

- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable
- 500: Internal Server Error
