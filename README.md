## üîé About the project

The Casting Agency API  is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies.

## üí™ Motivation for project

This is the capstone project of Udacity fullstack nanodegree program. It demonstrates our skills to develop and deploy a RESTful API.

## üëâ What I have built ?

- **Backend**
  - Fully functionnal API to manage Actors and Movies
  - Applying software system risk and compliance principles
  - SQLAlchemy
  - Migrations

- **Securing The REST API**
  - Implementing authentication and authorization in Flask using the [Auth0 API](https://auth0.com/)
  - Designing against key security principals
  - Implementing role-based control design patterns

- **Testing**
  - Testing endpoints with **Postman** and **Pytest**

- **Devops**
  - CircleCI pipline to automate tests after commit
  - Docker
  - Deploying the API to Heroku


## ‚ú® Deployed API

- **URL** : [https://agency-casting-api.herokuapp.com/](https://agency-casting-api.herokuapp.com/)
- **API V1 URL**: [https://agency-casting-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1](https://agency-casting-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1)
- **health check**: [https://agency-casting-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/health](https://agency-casting-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/health)

## ü§ì Getting Started (local)

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.10

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

## üíª Running the server (local)

First ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

You will need to add envirement variables, either to the ` setup.sh ` or to ` .env ` file:

> If added to setup.sh, please add ` export ` at the begining of each line.

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=""
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=""
AUTH0_DOMAIN=""
ALGORITHMS=['RS256']
API_AUDIENCE=""
```

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

```bash
source ./setup.sh
```

Then run the server:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.


## ‚úÖ Running the tests (local)

### Pytest

To run tests:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```

To get the coverage report:

```bash
coverage report -m
```


**Coverage report example**

     alt="Coverage report"
     width="400"/>
     

### Postman

First you need to start the server, import postman collectoion from postman folder and run tests.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90851774/207124182-cc632b39-3848-41f5-92a9-56d6e19a451f.png)


## üìñ API Reference

### Getting Started

- **Base URL**:
  - local app: the default url is http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/
  - deployed app: https://agency-casting-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/

- **Authentication**: Endpoints need a JWT token generated by the Auth0 after user's login.
  - Bearer {token} 
- **Permission**: All endpoints need a specific permission (see bellow for more detail). They are included in the JWT Token from Auth0.
- **Headers**: 
  - "Content-Type": "application/json"
  - "Accept": "application/json"


### Auth0 roles

- Casting Assistant
    - Can view actors and movies
- Casting Director
    - All permissions a Casting Assistant has and‚Ä¶
    - Add or delete an actor from the database
    - Modify actors or movies
- Executive Producer
    - All permissions a Casting Director has and‚Ä¶
    - Add or delete a movie from the database

### Postman request examples

A postman collection with request examples could be found in the postman folder: "FSND-Casting-Agency.postman_collection.json"

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```json
{
    "success": false, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request",
}
```

The API will return three error types when requests fail:

- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable
- 500: Internal Server Error
